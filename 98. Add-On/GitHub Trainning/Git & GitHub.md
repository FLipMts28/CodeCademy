# Introduction: Git & GitHub # 

Introduction to our Learn Git & GitHub course.

In this course, we will cover the basic functions of Git & GitHub.

Through lessons, projects, articles, and tutorials, you’ll practice using basic Git commands in the terminal to add version control to your project. This means you can switch between different versions of your progress, and branch off to create new features while preserving a main working copy.

We will go over how to integrate Git with GitHub, one of the most-used web applications by developers across the world to collaborate in teams and share code.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

    * Create a Git project and set up a remote copy on GitHub.
    * Label code changes and move between different versions of your project.
    * Write text on the GitHub interface using Markdown to describe your project and code changes.
    * Create branches in your Git project so you can collaborate with others.
    * Use Git commands to make sure your local copy of code matches the remote copy on GitHub.
    * Use GitHub pull requests to discuss code changes with others.
    * Be familiar with Git rebase, GitHub repository settings, and how to keep a remote repository organized.
    * How to create a GitHub profile and explore code written by others
    * Be familiar with intermediate to advanced GitHub features that allow you to manage tasks within GitHub itself and automate actions

There’s quite a bit in this course, so let’s dive in!

## Git Workflow ##

Nice! We have a Git project. A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

    A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
    A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
    A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository. In Git, we save changes with a commit, which we will learn more about in this lesson.
