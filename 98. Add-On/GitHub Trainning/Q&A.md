## What is a Portfolio Project? ##

This project is a little different from other Codecademy projects you’ve encountered. In this project, you will bring together what you have learned in previous lessons to build a project in your own development environment and publish it to the web!

Create your own files outside of the Codecademy platform

Write your own code with less guided instructions

Use common project management processes to track your progress

## How Do Portfolio Projects Work? ## 

We’ll provide you with high-level tasks to guide your project to completion, but you will be responsible for deciding how to implement them in your code.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Note that there are hints that can assist you, but they will only provide one potential implementation. Do not worry if your program looks different from ours!

## Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository ##

Codecademy Docs is a free and open-contribution resource that contains entries spanning many common languages, libraries, frameworks, and more. Users worldwide are encouraged to share their knowledge and expertise by creating an entry about a chosen topic. In this project, we will show you how to break up the task of contributing an entry into bite-sized sub-tasks so that you too can make a contribution. The steps to contribute are explained in detail in this article.

Contributing to Codecademy Docs is an excellent way for beginners to practice their GitHub and open-source contribution skills. It also looks great to potential employers!
