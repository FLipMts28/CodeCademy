Links have four main states: normal (not clicked), hover, active (clicked), and visited. These four states have associated CSS pseudo-classes: :link, :hover, :active, and :visited. These four states can be used to give a full range of visual feedback to users about the status of their link interaction.

Each state should still make it clear that the element in question is a link, meaning it should not make text identical to non-link text or alter the link’s appearance so much that users could perceive its behavior differently.

The ordering of link state pseudo-class rules is important to reveal the proper information. When a user hovers and then clicks a link, those styles should always override the static styling surrounding a user’s history with the link (unvisited :link and :visited). The proper order of these rules is:

    :link
    :visited
    :hover
    :active

This ordering will ensure that the rules cascade properly and the user can receive the most applicable visual feedback about the state of the link.
