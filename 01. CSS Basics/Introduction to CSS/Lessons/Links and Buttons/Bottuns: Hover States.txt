Just as with links, buttons should make use of hover states and the cursor: pointer declaration. All the caveats about the shortcomings of hover states on mobile devices apply to buttons, but their use is still encouraged.

Users expect buttons to be clickable. Since buttons can consist of any number of total elements (rectangular/circular body, text, image(s)), all elements should be clickable, should display their clickability, and should result in the same behavior.
