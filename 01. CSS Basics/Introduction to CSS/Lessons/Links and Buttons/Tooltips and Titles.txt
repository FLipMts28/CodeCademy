In addition to providing descriptive anchor text, it is sometimes helpful to provide additional context to explain links. This context can be particularly helpful when a link contains or consists of an image, icon, or another non-text element.

Additional context can be provided as text using the HTML title attribute. Although the title attribute can be provided to any HTML element, it is often extremely useful as additional context or advisory text for clickable elements.

Most browsers will display the text of a title attribute as a tooltip, meaning when a user hovers their cursor over an element, the text will appear in a small box near the cursor.

To add tooltips to a clickable element like a link, add it as the title attribute.
